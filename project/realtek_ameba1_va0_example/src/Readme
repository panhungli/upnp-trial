Concept:
  Launch three threads to handle
  1. Wifi standalone mode, which will be connected to WiFi AP 'LAB-RT0'
  2. upnp ssdp multicast on group ip '239.255.255.250', port 1900
  3. upnp soap, which will response with device description.

How to use:
  1. Add upnp_demo.c, upnp_upnp.c, upnp_httpd.c into Makefile
  2. Add function call "upnp_demo_init()" in main.c
  3. Compile
  4. Write into board and reboot
